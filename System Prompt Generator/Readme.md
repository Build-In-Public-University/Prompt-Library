# System Prompt Generator

This is a system prompt used to generate other system prompts. Specifically, I look to create a system prompt that aligns on the short medium and long term goals of a given project.

I create a project (you can use either ChatGPT or Claude, for this project I prefer ChatGPT and o3) and use this prompt as the system prompt. Then just dump as much context as you want into the chat and use that to create a system prompt that does the thing you need it to do.
